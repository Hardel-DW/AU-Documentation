## Debile role

At the start of a game, a randomly chosen person will become Debile, he will then have a pink screen,  
and the name to display in pink, only the Debile can see his name in color.  
The principle is simple it must be voted to win.
He must therefore be suspected but not too much.
The impostors can take advantage of this role, saying that they are so-called Debile

# Q&A
## Can you play Proximity Chat (Crewlink) with it?
Yes, Crewlink supports Among Us Modifications

## Can you get banned for playing on public Servers?
At the current state of the game there is no perma ban system for the game. The mod is designed in a way, that it does not send prohibited server requests. You are also able to join your own custom server to be safe [(Impostor)](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)

## Do my friends need to install the mod to play it together?
